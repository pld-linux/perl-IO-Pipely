%description
Pipes are troublesome beasts because there are a few different,
incompatible ways to create them.  Not all platforms support all ways,
and some platforms may have hidden difficulties like incomplete or
buggy support.

IO::Pipely provides a couple functions to portably create one- and
two-way pipes and pipe-like socket pairs.  It acknowledges and works
around known platform issues so you don't have to.

On the other hand, it doesn't work around unknown issues, so please
report any problems early and often.

IO::Pipely currently understands pipe(), UNIX-domain socketpair() and
regular IPv4 localhost sockets.  This covers every platform tested so
far, but it's hardly complete.  Please help support other mechanisms,
such as INET-domain socketpair() and IPv6 localhost sockets.

IO::Pipely will use different kinds of pipes or sockets depending on
the operating system's capabilities and the number of directions
requested.  The autodetection may be overridden by specifying a
particular pipe type.
